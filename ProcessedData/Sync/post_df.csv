While I picked a weight that was a bit too heavy for me, I still completed all repetitions for all sets","Keep track of best scores, and maybe a bit more lenient on the scoring/rep (the graph thing)",17

I enjoyed the music",Idk,I think I did alright. There were some reps where i was too fatigued to do properly,I think bicep curls aren't the best exercise for overall fitness as it is just an isolation exercise so I don't see it as very useful generally. So for general ppl this might not be that useful,I put a lot of effort. I was doing my best to match the wave,Idk,13
